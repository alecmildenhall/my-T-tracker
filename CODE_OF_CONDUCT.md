# Code of Conduct  
HRT Shot Tracker

This project is dedicated to creating software that supports transgender and gender-diverse people in safely tracking their hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Because this project deals with **sensitive health-related data**, the community that contributes to it must follow strong standards of respect, privacy, and ethical conduct.

This Code of Conduct establishes expectations for everyone who interacts with this project’s code, issues, discussions, documentation, and contribution processes.

## 1. Our Values

We strive to create a development environment that is:

### • Safe  
Contributors must act in ways that protect transgender users and respect the deeply personal nature of HRT data.

### • Respectful  
All participants should feel welcome regardless of gender identity, expression, transition status, or experience level.

### • Privacy-Centered  
We treat user data with the utmost care. Contributors must take privacy seriously and avoid sharing, exposing, or mishandling sensitive information.

### • Collaborative  
We work together with kindness, patience, and curiosity. Constructive feedback is encouraged; hostility or belittling behavior is not.

All contributors are expected to:

- Treat all individuals with dignity and respect.
- Use inclusive language and avoid assumptions about gender identity or medical experience.
- Prioritize user privacy in all design discussions and implementations.
- Follow the LICENSE and project governance rules, including contribution restrictions.
- Communicate with empathy, especially when discussing HRT, transition experiences, or health topics.
- Take responsibility for one’s actions and apologize for mistakes.
- Flag security or privacy concerns immediately rather than ignoring them.
